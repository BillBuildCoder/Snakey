# Snakey

i forgor smth
so i compile it with the java version i forgot so you should manually delete the .class file and update it yourself using javac SnakeGame.java
if you use java SnakeGame.class and it didnt work, and you have update it, try using java SnakeGame instead if java SnakeGame.class
also update your java to the latest ver
